# Project Charter: Nordeus Data Science Challenge 2024
## Project Title
Predicting User Activity for Enhanced User Retention in Top Eleven Mobile Game

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for forecasting user activity in the first 28 days after users re-register to play Top Eleven, a popular mobile game developed by Nordeus. By analyzing historical gameplay data and re-registration information, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can help improve user retention and engagement for returning players.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to enhance Nordeus' ability to re-engage users who have uninstalled the game and later re-registered. Accurately predicting user activity will enable the company to tailor personalized experiences and optimize marketing strategies, leading to improved player retention and a better overall user experience.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a Predictive Model: Create a robust model that forecasts the number of active days during the first 28 days after re-registration based on historical and re-registration data.

- Enhance User Retention Strategies: Provide insights to help Nordeus design targeted re-engagement strategies and personalized content to boost retention of returning players.

- Deliver Actionable Insights: Offer data-driven recommendations for Nordeus’ marketing and product teams to better understand the needs and behaviors of re-registered users.

## Scope
### In-Scope:
- Analysis of historical gameplay data and re-registration data.
- Development of machine learning models, including deep learning models, to predict user activity.
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization using tools like Optuna.
- Model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the primary metric.
- Delivery of a CSV file with predictions for test data.
- Recommendations for improving user retention based on model insights.
### Out of Scope:
- Real-time deployment of the model in production.
- Integration with Nordeus’ backend systems for automated predictions.
- Analysis of external data sources beyond the provided datasets.

## Key Stakeholders
- Project Sponsor: Nordeus Data Science Team
- Project Manager: Konstantinos Soufleros
